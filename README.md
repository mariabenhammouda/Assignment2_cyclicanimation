For cyclic animation assignment i wanted to create a space themed artwork.For the cyclic animation assignment, I wanted to create a space-themed artwork as I am constantly in awe of how outer space has perfectly ordered movement every second of the day. These movements are harmonious and never contradict one another.  This artwork implements circles of 2d and 3d to mimic a central plant with sub-planets revolving around it. This piece is user interactive as through the GUI one can play around with different textures, radii, positions, and sizes.

This piece relied only on circles to represent plants and their rings. It was interesting to me how different speeds, dimensions, and colors can create much depth and contrast in a piece. This artwork is visually pleasing and interactive, after seeing the final product, I imagine this would be a great addition to a scifi kid's exhibition. The background oscillates between dark blue and black to create depth as well as a great base for the rest of the colors to appear most vibrantly on. For the planet colors, I chose earthy tones with a palette generator. https://coolors.co/palette/6f1d1b-bb9457-432818-99582a-ffe6a7 . By creating a vector of type ofcolor, the code randomly generates one of the palette colors to set it to the next sphere drawn.

This piece has several components of motion. The movement of the plant ring through a combination of changes os speed and rotation angle. The movement of the sub-planets in the background as they change color and location.The movement through the fade between black and blue background. I like that the piece incorporates both messy movements and well-chosen movements. For instance, the sub-planets move almost chaotically as per the loudness of the audio, in contrast, the background harmoniously fades in and out of the colors black and blue.

This project was enjoyable to create and because I was dealing with movement and motion, I had to establish a point where adding more to the piece might make it overwhelming. I think that setting the different tempo to the motion of various objects in the artwork avoids making the motion overwhelming to the viewer. 

Overall, I'm pleased with the outcome of this assignment and I enjoyed the process. Initially, I had planned only to incorporate the motion of the ring only, but as we explored motion through sound I was intrigued by it. I appreciate that it includes the different dimensions of one shape to form a larger piece of artwork. I also enjoy the interactivity through the GUI and the sound reactive movements of the planets. Perhaps given more time, I would have explored how to adapt the sound reactive motion to the ring of the planet.
